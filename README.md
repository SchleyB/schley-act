Schley-act

This was just a fun little exercise to implement my own React-style framework from scratch utilizing a virtual DOM.
This is obviously not a fully-featured or production ready app and a lot of safety checks and compile steps have been skipped,
though hopefully it shows off the basic concepts of React in a straight-forward way.

To Run:

npm i
npm start
visit http://localhost:8080/ in browser
